It’s not enough to build a new internet. We’re committed to making it accessible to everyone. That’s why we’ve been working hard on producing tools to connect the Web2 technology stack to the Decentralized Future.

The Blockchain Institute recently released a suite of PHP tools to use with uPort DIDs. This module will be a core component of our upcoming WordPress Plugin, which will allow users to log into Web2 sites with Web3 Decentralized Identities!

You can find the library on our <a href="https://github.com/blockchaininstitutechi/jwttools" target="_blank">Github</a>.
