<p>The Blockchain Institute was founded in 2018 to promote the adoption and development of distributed ledger technology. The founding year has been an exciting one for blockchain and decentralized technology.</p>

<p>In 2019, our flagship location will be opening in Chicago, where we'll be offering in-person courses as well as a wide range of online resources to give you the tools you need to build Web 3. We've been working with our partners to build the foundation for what will come, and we hope you'll join us as we continue to grow.
