This past June, Blockchain Institute both sponsored and participated in GirlCon for the 2nd year in a row.

The event is designed to empower the next generation of female leaders. GirlCon offers young women a chance to connect with and learn about a variety of companies spanning numerous industries.

The Institute was pleased to have an opportunity to share our mission with attendees, teach them about blockchain, and explain how the technology can help build a better tomorrow. Our very own Jeremy Cogan even had an opportunity to lead a breakout session and introduce blockchain to some of the many attendees.
