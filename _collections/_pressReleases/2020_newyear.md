<p>The past year has been a really exciting one for us! We want to extend a huge thank you to everyone that made it possible. Before we get into our plans for 2020 we thought a quick look back at all of our accomplishments from 2019 would be the best way to ring in the new year.</p>

<h3>Teaching Blockchain</h3>
<p>This year we were able to teach and present across Chicago to help educate everyone we could about blockchain. Some of the highlights of our year include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Girlcon 2019</li>
  <li>Chicagobility</li>
  <li>Blockchain Training Conference 2019</li>
	<li>Voice of Blockchain 2019</li>
	<li>Chicago’s Junior Economic Club</li>
</ul> 

<p>We are very excited to finally be hosting in-person classes to help onboard people into cryptocurrency and blockchain.</p>

<h>We Moved!</h3>
<p>We're excited to announce that we've now taken up residence in Chicago's HackHaus, a space dedicated to promoting technology advancement. While moving was a major hurdle, our new space boasts a large teaching area, as well as co-working space for other decentralized projects.</p>

<p>The space has allowed us to expand from online-only courses to in-person classes and being able to host a variety of blockchain and cryptocurrency-related events. It also gives us some breathing room which is much appreciated.</p>

<h3>What’s Coming in 2020</h3>
<b>The Crypto Curious Course is Back</b>
<p>In case you missed it for the first time, Blockchain Institute's in-person Crypto Curious Course will return on the 25th of January 2020.</p>

<p>The Crypto Curious Course is a free 4-hour workshop with a simple goal. You will walk away understanding how transactions work on a blockchain and see the powerful potential of decentralized technology.</p>

<b>New Online Courses Incoming</b>
<p>We have two new online courses that are almost done and ready to share. Stay tuned for more information and their release dates.</p>
