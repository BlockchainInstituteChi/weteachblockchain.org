The Blockchain Institute’s mission is, simply put, to teach blockchain! To assist us in accomplishing this goal, we currently offer a variety of online courses.

Our current online curriculum includes Blockchain 101, Blockchain Security, and Bitcoin for Developers. Rounding out the field, we also have courses that cover Decentralized Storage, Intro To Hyperledger, and Intro To IPFS (Interplanetary File System).

There are also more subjects on the way. Topics like Blockchain For Business, Cryptography, and Stable Coins are just a few of the courses that are currently in the works.

On the topic of stable coins, Facebook’s Libra debuted on June 18th. Want to know more about it? Hannah Rosenberg, Managing Director here at the Institute, spent two days going over six different Libra documents, browsing commentary, watching videos and discussing it with colleagues. You can read her notes on Libra here.

Feedback, comments, and suggestions for new courses are always appreciated. Feel free to share your thoughts with us via our official contact page. Your feedback will help us improve the tools we have to share this vitally important technology with the world.
