<p>One of Blockchain Institute’s primary focuses in the 2nd quarter of 2019 was getting involved with the community. To achieve this goal, staff members participated in several Chicago-based events, which provided opportunities to spread the blockchain gospel and further educate the masses regarding the many benefits of this transformative technology.</p>

<p>Moreover, we here at the institute have been working diligently to add additional modules to our ever-growing list of blockchain courses. With that in mind, it’s time to take a closer look at some quarter two highlights.</p>

<h3>Blockchain Community Events</h3>

<b>Exploring Engineering</b>
<p>On April 18, 2019, The Blockchain Institute attended Exploring Engineering – an event hosted by Amos Alonzo Stagg High School. The purpose of the gathering was to introduce teenagers to the word of engineering and consider the benefits of a career in the field.</p>

<p>The Institute set up shop at the event and spent the evening sharing blockchain education material, while also answering any question the attendees had.</p>

<b>Chicago Universities Blockchain Summit</b>
<p>The Chicago Universities Blockchain Summit took place on May 18, 2019. The Blockchain Institute was pleased to help sponsor this event, which was hosted by Northwestern Pritzker School of Law.</p>

<p>The purpose of the summit was to teach students about the value of digital currency, discuss the latest developments in the space, and connect college students with professionals who are currently working in the industry.</p>

<p>Clubs from Northwestern University, University of Chicago, DePaul University, The University of Illinois in Chicago, and The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign were all in attendance.</p>

<b>GirlCon 2019</b>
<p>This past June, Blockchain Institute both sponsored and participated in GirlCon for the 2nd year in a row.</p>

<p>The event is designed to empower the next generation of female leaders.  GirlCon offers young women a chance to connect with and learn about a variety of companies spanning numerous industries.</p>

<p>The Institute was pleased to have an opportunity to share our mission with attendees, teach them about blockchain, and explain how the technology can help build a better tomorrow. Our very own Jeremy Cogan even had an opportunity to lead a breakout session and introduce blockchain to some of the many attendees.</p> 

<h3>Online Lessons Are Now Available</h3>
<p>Blockchain Institute’s mission is, simply put, to teach blockchain!  To assist us in accomplishing this goal, we currently offer a variety of online courses.<p>

<p>Our current online curriculum includes  Blockchain 101, Blockchain Security, and Bitcoin for Developers.  Rounding out the field, we also have courses that cover Decentralized Storage, Intro To Hyperledger, and Intro To IPFS (Interplanetary File System).</p>

<p>There are also more subjects on the way. Topics like Blockchain For Business, Cryptography, and Stable Coins are just a few of the courses that are currently in the works.</p>

<p>On the topic of stable coins, Facebook’s Libra debuted on June 18th. Want to know more about it? Hannah Rosenberg, Managing Director here at the Institute, spent two days going over six different Libra documents, browsing commentary, watching videos and discussing it with colleagues. You can read her notes on Libra here.</p>

<p>Feedback, comments, and suggestions for new courses are always appreciated. Feel free to share your thoughts with us via our official contact page. Your feedback will help us improve the tools we have to share this vitally important technology with the world.</p>

<h3>Contributing to Web3</h3>
<p>It's not enough to build a new internet. We're committed to making it accessible to everyone. That's why we've been working hard on producing tools to connect the Web2 technology stack to the Decentralized Future.</p>

<p>The Blockchain Institute recently released a suite of PHP tools to use with uPort DIDs. This module will be a core component of our upcoming Wordpress Plugin, which will allow users to log into Web2 sites with Web3 Decentralized Identities!</p>

<p>You can find the library on our Github.</p>
