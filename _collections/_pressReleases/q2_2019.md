One of Blockchain Institute’s primary focuses in the 2nd quarter of 2019 was getting involved with the community. To achieve this goal, staff members participated in several Chicago-based events, which provided opportunities to spread the blockchain gospel and further educate the masses regarding the many benefits of this transformative technology.

Moreover, we here at the institute have been working diligently to add additional modules to our ever-growing list of blockchain courses. With that in mind, it’s time to take a closer look at some quarter two highlights.
Blockchain Community Events
Exploring Engineering

On April 18, 2019, The Blockchain Institute attended Exploring Engineering – an event hosted by Amos Alonzo Stagg High School. The purpose of the gathering was to introduce teenagers to the word of engineering and consider the benefits of a career in the field.

The Institute set up shop at the event and spent the evening sharing blockchain education material, while also answering any question the attendees had.
