On October 13th the Blockchain Institute was proud to sponsor a South Side Blockchain Meetup. Eager programmers of all skill levels participated in the event. The topic focused on the Loom Network and their gamified Solidity tutorial, <a href="https://cryptozombies.io/" target="_blank">Crypto Zombies</a>.

Crypto Zombies is a web app that creates a guided path for users to learn Solidity, the primary programming language used on the Ethereum network. LaTaevia Berry, cofounder of South Side Blockchain, led the workshop.
