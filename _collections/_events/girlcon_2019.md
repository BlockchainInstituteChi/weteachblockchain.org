Blockchain Institute was proud to sponsor and participate in Girlcon 2019!

GirlCon is an annual Chicago-based event that takes place in mid-June that focuses on empowering the next generation of female leaders. GirlCon has breakout sessions from numerous companies that the attendees will have the opportunity to learn from and make connections with.

While at the event, we set up a booth, informing participants on blockchain technology, Blockchain Institute’s mission, and how it could possibly impact their future. We also gave away free swag to everyone like tee shirts, privacy camera covers, stickers, phone pop sockets and more!

Jeremy led a breakout session to educate and inform students interested in learning about blockchain technology and its possibilities. It was a privilege to teach such an engaged audience that is likely to shape the future of STEM fields!
