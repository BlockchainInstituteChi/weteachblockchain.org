The Halving refers to upcoming changes to the Bitcoin production rate. This meetup sponsored by our partner organization will help you learn what you need to know.
The halving has already occurred twice, each time boosting Bitcoin's price by at least 10x, will this time be the same?

Join us as we discuss:
<ul>
  <li>The Reasoning Behind the Halving</li>
  <li>How Halving Affects the Price of BTC</li>
  <li>Why Current Hash Rate Acceleration Suggests the Bitcoin Halving Could Happen SOONER than expected</li>
  <li>What You Can Do to Prepare for the Halving</li>
</ul> 

There will be pizza and soft drinks available, so join us for food, friends and networking.
