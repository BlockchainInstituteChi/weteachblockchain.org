One key way that the Institute promotes adoption is by content creation and distribution. Our delegates will be providing educational resources as well as recording the event, so stop by our booth and get in on the action!

The International Blockchain Congress is held annually in Chicago to promote the adoption of blockchain and distributed systems. This year's focus on smart contracts attracted leading experts from Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, Western Asia, Australia, and North America. <a href="https://blockchain.wtf/wtf-productions/international-blockchain-congress/" target="_blank">See video from the event here</a>
