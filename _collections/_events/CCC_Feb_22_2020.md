The Crypto Curious Course is a four-hour workshop with a simple goal: You will walk away from it understanding how transactions work on a blockchain and see the powerful potential of decentralized technology.

You will even have the opportunity to exchange a $20 bill for bitcoin using a RockItCoin cryptocurrency ATM and send it to a secure digital wallet during the course. We will be present to hold your hand through the process.
