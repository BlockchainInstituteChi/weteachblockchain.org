One of the ways the institute has helped build the Chicago community is by attracting experts to speak at local events, which ensures that Chicago's blockchain enthusiasts can stay up to date and involved in this rapidly evolving industry.

We teamed up with the Bitcoin and Open Blockchain Meetup once again to help promote the new book 'The Bitcoin Standard' and share some educational resources with the community. <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Bitcoin-Open-Blockchain-Community-Chicago/events/253210845/" target="_blank">See the event online</a>.
