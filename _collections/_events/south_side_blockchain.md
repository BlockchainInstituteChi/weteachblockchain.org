SOUTH SIDE BLOCKCHAIN MEETUP

<em>OCTOBER 13</em>

On October 13th the Blockchain Institute was proud to sponsor the South Side Blockchain Meetup. Eager programmers of all skill levels participated in the event. The topic focused on the Loom Network and their gamified Solidity tutorial, Crypto Zombies.

Crypto Zombies is a web app that creates a guided path for users to learn Solidity, the primary programming language used on the Ethereum network. LaTaevia Berry, cofounder of South Side Blockchain, led the workshop.Â <a href="https://theblockchaininstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/South-Side-Blockchain1">See the meetup group here.</a>
