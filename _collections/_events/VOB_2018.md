The Blockchain Institute is proud to sponsor the Voice of Blockchain. The VoB event was held at Navy Pier in Chicago, and attracted a wide range of speakers from across the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. The event was split into four tracks innovation, social good, fintech, and buidl so attendees could focus on what they value. Our own Hannah Rosenberg spoke on the 'Solving Scalability' panel. In addition to offering free educational resources to attendees, our team provided a media booth and interviewed key influencers in the space to help them share their perspectives.Â <a href="https://voiceofblockchain.com/" target="_blank">See the event online.</a>
