<h2>Details</h2>
Jeremy from the Blockchain Institute led a workshop for the Junior Economic Club of Chicago helping explain what exactly a blockchain is and how they work. The students were able to test out a new activity that let them play the part of a node and simulate the mining process. Prizes were won, fun was had and everyone walked away knowing a little bit more about blockchain and decentralized systems.
The <a href="https://www.junioreconomicclub.org/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Junior Economic Club of Chicago</a> is a student-led 501Â©(3) nonprofit that exposes high school students to the fields of economics, finance, and business.
