In August, The Blockchain Institute's Managing Director, Hannah Rosenberg, taught a session at the <a href="https://blockchaintraining.org/home/home/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blockchain Training Conference</a> in Denver.

Organized by C4 (CryptoCurrency Certification Consortium) and aantonop Events, BTC2019 is an educational conference designed with learning objectives in mind and teachers that care about what you take away from their sessions.

At Hannah's session, attendees learned what the Lightning Network is, why it exists, how it works, and various ways it can be used in commerce. The session included a Lightning demo and attendees were introduced to Lightning concepts and tools such as channel liquidity, channel balancing, watchtowers, as well as a wide variety of tools that can be used to enable Lightning commerce such as payment processors, and Lightning point of sale systems.
