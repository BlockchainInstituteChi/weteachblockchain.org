GIRLCON 2018

<i>JUNE 16</i>

A special focus of the Blockchain Institute has been to promote education among younger audiences who have the potential to be the next generation of software designers.

GirlCon is an annual conference in Chicago dedicated to promoting STEM education among young women. Our team helped to make blockchain education accessible to this group by offering educational talks and resources. <a href="https://theblockchaininstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/girlcon.io">See the event online.</a>
