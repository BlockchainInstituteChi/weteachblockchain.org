<span>In the brave new world of cryptographic assets, it can be confusing to determine what is what. When talking about cryptocurrency, the terms "coin" and "token" are often used interchangeably, even though this is not quite correct. There are a few subtle differences between coins and tokens.</span>

<strong>Coins </strong>- Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, etc.
<ul>
 	<li>Are highly divisible and can be traded</li>
 	<li>Have their own blockchain network</li>
 	<li>Can be earned as rewards for mining or maintaining the network</li>
</ul>
<strong>Tokens </strong>- Golem, 0x Protocol, Gemini Dollar
<ul>
 	<li>Do not have their own blockchain network, or build on top of an existing network</li>
 	<li>Cannot be earned for mining or network maintenance</li>
 	<li>Can be earned for providing specific on-chain services</li>
</ul>
<strong>Assets </strong>-<a href="https://www.cryptokitties.co/">Cryptokitties</a>, Property Titles
<ul>
 	<li>Are not divisible but can be traded</li>
 	<li>Cannot be earned for mining or network maintenance</li>
