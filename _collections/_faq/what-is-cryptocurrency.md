<h3>Background</h3>
<span> Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin or ether are scarce digital assets which exist on a decentralized network of computers. The currencies, which are referred to as coins or tokens, can be used within their network as a digital store of value or a medium of exchange. </span>

<h3>Digital Ownership</h3>
In the same way that ownership of a house or a car is controlled by whoever holds the deed, a cryptographic asset is owned by whoever holds the private cryptographic key that is registered with the network. The difference with cryptographic assets is that instead of a central registry, a network of many peers keeps track of who owns each asset.

<h3>Transferring Digital Assets</h3>
When a cryptocurrency transaction occurs, the sender broadcasts a message to the network indicating that they are transferring assets under their control to another user on the network. They specify the receiver's public address within the network, and the owner can only access assets transferred to that address if they have the corresponding cryptographic key.
