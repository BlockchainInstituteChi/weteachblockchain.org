title: Tokens Using IPFS

Currently, the only token using IPFS is <a href="https://filecoin.io/">Filecoin</a>, which promotes a unique <a href="https://filecoin.io/proof-of-replication.pdf">Proof of Spacetime and Replication algorithm</a>. While Filecoin is still in development, it has the potential to lead a revolution in the way that we share value and exchange information online. The graphic below depicts how a token can be used as an incentive mechanism in a storage network.

    bodyText="<br><b>1:</b> <i><b>PUT:</b> Clients <b>(a)</b> send information about the file, storage duration, and a small amount of filecoin to the Storage Market as a bid. Simultaneously, Miners <b>(b)</b> submit asks, competing to offer low cost storage. Deals are made in the Storage Market, on the blockchain.;</i><br><b>2:</b> <i><b>SEND:</b> The Client <b>(a)</b> then sends the file to the Miner <b>(b)</b>, and the Miner adds the file to a sector. The sectors are cryptographically sealed, with verification sent to the blockchain.;</i><br><b>3:</b> <i><b>MANAGE:</b> Miners <b>(b)</b> continuously prove they are storing all sectors they agreed to store. The clientâ€™s payment is released in installments. Additional currency is minted over time and awarded to Miners <b>(b)</b> as a block reward, proportional to the storage they provide.;</i><br><b>4:</b> <i><b>GET:</b> A Client <b>(a)</b> requests a file with some payment in filecoin to the Retrieval Market (off chain); the first Miner <b>(b)</b> to send the file is paid. Eventually, the contract expires and the storage is once again free."
