What this course aims to teach is some prevalent issues common to users and developers of decentralized systems. As there are many technologies involved in the use of blockchains, each with its own area of concern, we cannot address all of them in detail. However, if you want to know what practical steps can be taken to secure yourself or the system you work on, this course is for you!

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">Blockchain</a> (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger">Distributed Ledger</a>) technology provides a unique system of trust within a network. The ledger tracks the data generated within a system and is distributed amongst a network of peers. This ensures that no one can tamper with the information, which enables a range of new possibilities. 

<em>It is highly recommended you finish the <a href="/courses/blockchain-101/">Blockchain 101</a> course before starting Blockchain Security as it expands on topics introduced there.</em>
