Throughout this module we've explored how the Ethereum Virtual Machine can be used to build decentralized applications. Because these systems are quite complex, it's important to avoid trying to shoehorn the wrong business model into a decentralized format. The following process can serve as a litmus test to identify if a problem needs a decentralized solution.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step is to verify that the problem you want to solve is actually possible to approach with a decentralized solution. </span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can this problem be solved with minimal reliance on third-party data?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it always possible to determine a logical outcome for the problem?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it possible for this solution to operate with complete transparency?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can the outcome of the problem be resolved to the movement of on-chain assets?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is it possible for this solution to exist without the need for digital asset management?</span></li>
</ol>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">If the answer to all of the last questions was "Yes" then it may also help to confirm that a blockchain-based solution is appropriate. There could be an easier or cheaper alternative, so it's best to consider whether a decentralized solution is actually the optimal course.</span>
<ol>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are there large inefficiencies due to incomplete or inaccurate information in existing solutions?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there a need for more equitable ownership and access to these kinds of systems?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there a need for greater freedom of expression or open communication within this system?</span></li>
 	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there a need for greater assurance or automation in this process?</span></li>
</ol>
