Once you open the page, an IPFS node will start to run right in your browser. This is similar to how many games will load a client locally, and use it to connect to the wider network. The website you're viewing is running a small IPFS node with local javascript storage in your browser. Don't worry - it will be automatically turned off and cleared if you close the window. In fact, every refresh of this page will have a different node ID and address. You can see the details of the node in the top left corner of the user interface.</span>
