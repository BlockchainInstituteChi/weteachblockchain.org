The IPFS web portal makes uploading and sharing files using IPFS easy. As a demonstration, we'll store this photo of Alex's dog on IPFS and share it with ourselves. </span>

Here's the image:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11694" src="https://theblockchaininstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Dog.jpg" alt="" width="1639" height="766" />

<h3>UPLOADING</h3>

<hr />

You can now click and drag files onto the drop box on the right to upload them to your node. Once uploaded, you'll see them added to the list as shown below.

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-11695" src="https://theblockchaininstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/FilesUpload.jpg" alt="" width="1135" height="578" />

&nbsp;

<h3>SHARING</h3>
<hr />

You can also send a link to this page to allow others to easily download the same file. Just click the 'Link' button on the right once your upload is complete. The IPFS address of this file is:<code>QmT6s9dZXRFbxGhvSW68BdZEFF9mHaTW6erH3TNMrRGZfX</code> so if you'd like to download it through the web interface, you could do so at <em><a href="https://try-ipfs.theblockchaininstitute.org/?q=QmT6s9dZXRFbxGhvSW68BdZEFF9mHaTW6erH3TNMrRGZfX">https://try-ipfs.theblockchaininstitute.org/?q=QmT6s9dZXRFbxGhvSW68BdZEFF9mHaTW6erH3TNMrRGZfX</a></em>.

As we'll explore more in the following section, IPFS addresses are file-specific, not owner specific. The addressÂ is actually a unique key for the file that you uploaded. It's derived by taking the hash of the file, which means that it can also act as a checksum. If anyone tries to send you another file in its place, your node will reject the imposter when it's hash does not match that which was requested.</span>

<h2> Here's a sub-header - keep in mind that pages will have a banner with the course title and the lesson title, so these should just contain section breaks and supplementary information.</h2>

<img src="/assets/img/test.png"> 
<span class="imgDetail">This is a note below the image explaining what it is. Be sure to add an image with a matching name to the folder /assets/img.</span>

<h3> Here's another kind of header that could be useful</h3>

<div class="callout">
    <h1>This is a fancy callout div</h1>
    <span>You can use any normal formatting elements in here... they'll just have some cool formatting once we finish the site.</span>
</div>

<a href="https://linktosomewebsite.com/somepage">this is a link</a>

<a href="https://linktosomewebsite.com/somepage" target="_blank">this is a link that opens in a new tab</a>

<span>you can also put a <a href="https://linktosomewebsite.com/somepage" target="_blank">link with some text as a handle</a> inside of another element (like this span)</span>
