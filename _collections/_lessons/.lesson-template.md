Example header content:

---
layout: lesson
course: blockchain101
module: 1
title: Lesson 1
permalink: /courses/blockchain-101/1/Lesson-1
---
-->

<span> This is where the lesson content would go.</span>

<h2> Here's a sub-header - keep in mind that pages will have a banner with the course title and the lesson title, so these should just contain section breaks and supplementary information.</h2>

<img src="/assets/img/test.png"> 
<span class="imgDetail">This is a note below the image explaining what it is. Be sure to add an image with a matching name to the folder /assets/img.</span>

<h3> Here's another kind of header that could be useful</h3>

<div class="callout">
    <h1>This is a fancy callout div</h1>
    <span>You can use any normal formatting elements in here... they'll just have some cool formatting once we finish the site.</span>
</div>

<a href="https://linktosomewebsite.com/somepage">this is a link</a>

<a href="https://linktosomewebsite.com/somepage" target="_blank">this is a link that opens in a new tab</a>

<span>you can also put a <a href="https://linktosomewebsite.com/somepage" target="_blank">link with some text as a handle</a> inside of another element (like this span)</span>
