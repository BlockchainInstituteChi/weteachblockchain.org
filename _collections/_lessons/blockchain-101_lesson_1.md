<span class="openingParagraph">To understand the potential of blockchain technology, it’s helpful to understand the context of this wave of innovation by looking at the first blockchain, Bitcoin, and its first use-case, digital money.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The concepts and ideas that would lead to blockchain and cryptocurrency date back to the early 1980s. The next 25 years saw the rise and fall of many digital cash projects and culminated in Satoshi Nakamoto creating Bitcoin, the first blockchain. Nakamoto solved the problems faced by previous failed digital cash projects, including maintaining a reliable peer-to-peer network and preventing against counterfeit. Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation was a transparent, secure ledger that could not be compromised; once any information is added to the chain, it cannot be removed. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The architecture of a blockchain allows peers to interact in a trustless system without the aid of an intermediary. Blockchains are able to do this by having the network members reach consensus, a computationally-intensive process secured by cryptography. While there are many apparent benefits to blockchains, the technology is still relatively young and is yet to meet the full demand faced by networks today. Despite these unknowns, there is still a lot of intrigue over the potential impact of blockchain technologies.</span>
