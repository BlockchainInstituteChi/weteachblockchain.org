<h3>YOU'VE COMPLETED PART ONE OF OUR BITCOIN FOR DEVELOPERS COURSE!</h3>

<hr />

This completes part I of our Bitcoin for Developers course! We hope that you now have a foundational understanding of the problems Bitcoin was built to solve, through to cryptography and decentralized network basics and on to what a bitcoin actually is and how it’s stored.

Congrats on finish Part I of this course, we'd really love to hear what you thought of it! You can send us an email at <a href="mailto:info@weteachblockchain.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">info@weteachblockchain.org</a> or type us a message via our <a href="/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact form</a>. Your feedback is very valuable as we work on part II.

In the next part of the course we’ll take a deep dive into Bitcoin transactions and cover how to integrate bitcoin payments into an e-commerce shop. Until then, check out the many other course the Institute <a href="/courses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offers.</a>
