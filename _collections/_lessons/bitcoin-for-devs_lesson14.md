<h3>YOU'VE COMPLETED PART ONE OF OUR BITCOIN FOR DEVELOPERS COURSE!</h3>

<hr />

This completes part I of our Bitcoin for Developers course! We hope that you now have a foundational understanding of the problems Bitcoin was built to solve, through to cryptography and decentralized network basics and on to what a bitcoin actually is and how it’s stored.

Congrats on finish Part I of this course, we'd really love to hear what you thought of it!

Your feedback is very valuable as we work on part II.

In the next part of the course we’ll take a deep dive into Bitcoin transactions and cover how to integrate bitcoin payments into an e-commerce shop. Until then, check out the many other course the Institute <a href="https://theblockchaininstitute.org/courses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">offers.</a>
