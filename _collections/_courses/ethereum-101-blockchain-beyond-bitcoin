summary: In 2008, Satoshi Nakomoto triggered a revolution in financial sovereignty with the proposal of the Bitcoin distributed ledger. In the years that followed, developers around the world proposed adaptations of this design and expanded the idea we now call blockchain.<br>In 2015, a 19-year-old named Vitalik Buterin proposed that in addition to the value transfer functionality, the blockchain could be used to coordinate computers around the world and create a single global computer. In this course, weâ€™ll explore how the concept of a blockchain has evolved, and help you get familiar with the terminology and concepts of decentralized computing with Ethereum as an example.<br>This course covers the evolution of distributed ledger technology from Bitcoin to Blockchain. If you haven't yet, you may want to explore our Blockchain Center or Blockchain 101 to get up to speed on the vocabulary.
