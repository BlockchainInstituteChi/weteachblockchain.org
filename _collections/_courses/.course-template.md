summary: Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, and blockchain are all technologies that are increasingly in the public eye. This trend began just over a decade ago with a conceptual paper by Satoshi Nakamoto, an unidentified person (or group of people) who sought to develop a process that would prevent a repeat of the 2008-2009 global economic catastrophe. Since then, blockchain technology has emerged as an important technological implementation for individuals, governments and corporations alike. <br>The goal of this course is to familiarize students with the unique characteristics of the blockchain and its many iterations and applications, from Bitcoin to smart contracts, decentralized networks, and consensus mechanisms.
