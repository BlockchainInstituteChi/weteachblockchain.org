On March 25, 2019, Chicago’s Blockchain Institute was officially granted status as a <span class="no-wrap">501(c)(3)</span> Public Charity.

Blockchain Institute works to promote the adoption, development, and use of blockchain technology by providing free education to the public. Based in Chicago’s Uptown neighborhood, Blockchain Institute aims to educate those looking to gain knowledge or sharpen their skills on this emerging technology. As they have received their <span class="no-wrap">501(c)(3)</span> status, they are now able to accept a variety of cryptocurrencies, along with USD; these tax-exempt donations will help further their mission.

Blockchain Institute was established by Taylor Gerring, a Co-founder of the Ethereum Foundation; Andrew Gordon of Gordon Law Group; and Hannah Rosenberg, organizer of Chicago’s largest crypto community group—The Bitcoin and Open Blockchain Meetup.

The Blockchain Institute offers a variety of courses from Blockchain 101 to Bitcoin for Developers to Decentralized Storage. As Managing Director, Rosenberg explains, “It can be difficult to find quality, reliable information on Blockchain tech and the crypto economy. As a non-profit, we provide resources without any hidden agendas.”

Those who wish to contribute to this charitable organization can do so through the organization website, theblockchaininstitute.org/donations. These funds will provide not only resources to educate the blockchain community—but they can also be taken as a credit on future tax filings.
