Hello friends,

We hope you are all doing well in these new and stressful times. Like many organizations, we have been working from home for the last few weeks in order to do our part and stay home.
   
At the beginning of this year we thought our focus would be improving and expanding our in-person courses. Obviously things aren’t working out that way. With social distancing in full effect, it’s not responsible for us to hold in-person events. All of our classes and meetups are on hold until it is safe to have gatherings in public again.

What have we been working on? Rebuilding our website from scratch! With a better backbone our website will be able to offer more functionality around our courses in the future.

With our website changes, we are transitioning theblockchaininstitute (.org) to weteachblockchain (.org). You’ve seen us use #weteachblockchain before, but we are doubling down on this message and making it the center of who we are.

We will have more updates regarding our website coming soon, so stay tuned and stay home! 

<h3>Still Crypto Curious?</h3>
We're working on ways to bring you classroom sessions even while social distancing. Click below and let us know if you're interested in participating in the Crypto Curious Course online.

After our 2+ hour Crypto Curious Course you will be able to talk about blockchain and cryptocurrency with confidence. Learn how it works, where it came from, and how it’s different from traditional money. Tell us if we should bring this journey online!
