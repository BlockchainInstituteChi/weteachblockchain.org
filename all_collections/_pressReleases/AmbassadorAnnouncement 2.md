Today we are very proud to announce the Blockchain Institute Ambassador Program. We are building a community around the world to help educate everyone about the potential of decentralization and blockchain technology.

Ambassadors will have advanced access to the new material we will be teaching, as well as the ability to influence the direction of our future content. Are you fluent in multiple languages? Help us translate the material so we can offer it to students around the world.

We believe blockchain education is necessary for the future and want to make it free and available to all.

<h3>Instructors Wanted!</h3>

Members of our Ambassador Program that want to teach our in-person Crypto Curious Course can interview to become Instructors. Instructors receive a teacher’s guide that goes over how we teach our courses that have been built from the lessons we’ve learned. Additionally, you will be in direct communication with our staff so we can support and advise with any questions or issues you may have.

We offer training for Instructors via webinar so you can learn how to teach blockchain technology more effectively. Slides and extensive teacher notes for our Crypto Curious Course will also be provided to make getting started as easy as possible. There are also interactive activities and workshop guides to keep students interested.

You could even have your own courses, FAQs, or other docs published to the #WeTeachBlockchain Network and displayed on our website.
