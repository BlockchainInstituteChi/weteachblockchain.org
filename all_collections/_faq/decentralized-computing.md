Distributed computing has long been a theoretical concept in computer science, but in 2015 the Ethereum foundation took that theory one step closer to reality. Ethereumâ€™s stated goal and innovation was to create an economic incentive for participants to join this public network and help maintain a global, distributed, computer system.

Since 2015, Ethereum has risen to have one of the largest cryptocurrency communities, and a range of other similar projects have launched to provide more specialized versions of the Ethereum's unique decentralized computing network.

	bodyText="Ethereum Nodes store code, which can be executed by users who pay for the execution using Ethereum tokens. In this way, the network can act autonomously, without a centralized owner."
