<h2>Technical Terms</h2>
<h3>Address</h3>
Used to receive and send <a href="https://youtu.be/oP3bKCa8Rq4?list=PLVmd1I9lPns-xZJ_jBotqiQdfAxGD8_lz&t=3" target="_blank">transactions on a blockchain network</a>. It contains a string of alphanumeric characters, but can also be represented as a scannable <a href="https://weteachblockchain.org/faq/what-are-qr-codes/" target="_blank">QR code</a>.

<h3>Airdrop</h3>
Airdrops are a method of token distribution. Developers will send tokens to a blockchain address in exchange for a task, or even for free, to help decentralize the ownership of their tokens.

<h3>Blocks</h3>
Each block on a <a href="/faq/what-is-blockchain/" target="_blank">blockchain</a> represents a collection of transactions that have taken place. As the transactions are validated, they are compiled into the blockchain permanently. Blocks include a timestamp and are built in such a way that they cannot be changed once recorded.

<h3>Cryptography</h3> 
Mathematics creates codes and ciphers in order to conceal information. Cryptography is used as the basis for the mathematical problems used to verify and secure transactions on the Blockchain.

<h3>Decentralization</h3>
The process of moving control of a system from one <a href="/faq/what-is-decentralization/" target="_blank">centralized</a> location to many equal ones that can act on a peer-to-peer basis.

<h3>DeFi</h3>
Short for <a href="/decentralized-finance-course/" target="_blank">Decentralized Finance</a>, an open and modular financial system where you have more control than traditional financial systems. The goal of DeFi is to connect individual users to provide financial services without the need for a centralized bank.

<h3>DEX</h3>
Short for Decentralized Exchange. DEXs facilitate cryptocurrency transactions peer-to-peer without the need for a third party.

<h3>Exchange</h3> 
A website or organization that allows and facilitates the <a href="/faq/how-to-buy-bitcoin/" target="_blank">transfer of fiat to cryptocurrency</a> as well as the reverse. Some exchanges allow you to trade your crypto for other cryptocurrencies.

The process of <a href="https://youtu.be/Q_BtAGu5i_c?list=PLVmd1I9lPns-xZJ_jBotqiQdfAxGD8_lz&t=3" target="_blank">adding transactions to blocks</a> and securing the blockchain. Miners are specialized hardware that race to solve equations and add the next block to the chain. The computer that wins receives the block reward for creating the newly added block.  

<h3>Node</h3>
A computer that possesses a copy of the blockchain and is working to maintain it.

<h3>Peer-to-Peer (P2P)</h3>
A system in which computers talk directly to each other with no centralized system in between.

<h3>Private Key</h3>
A private key is a string of data can digitally prove you have access to the crypto in a specific wallet. Private keys can be thought of as a password; they must never be revealed to anyone, as they allow you to spend the bitcoins from your bitcoin wallet through a <a href="/courses/blockchain-101/02/asymmetric-encryption" target="_blank">cryptographic signature</a>.

<h3>Public Key</h3>
A cryptographic key that can be obtained and used by anyone to encrypt messages intended for a particular recipient, such that the encrypted messages can be deciphered only by
using a second key that is known only to the recipient (the private key).

<h3>Proof-of-Work</h3>
A system that ties mining capability to computational power. Blocks must be hashed, which is in itself an easy computational process, but an additional variable is added to the hashing process to make it more difficult. When a block is successfully hashed, the process must have taken some time and computational effort. Thus, a hashed block is considered proof of work.

<h3>Proof-of-Stake</h3>
An alternative to the proof-of-work system, in which your existing stake in a cryptocurrency (the amount of that currency that you hold) is used to calculate the amount of that currency that you can mine. The higher your stake, the more likely you are to be selected as a validator and receive a block reward.

<h3>Stablecoin</h3>
A cryptocurrency that attempts to peg it’s value to a fiat currency or commodity in an effort to deal with the volatility of the crypto market. 

<h3>Wallet</h3>
A physical device or computer interface that facilitates the storage of public and private keys. Your cryptocurrency is not stored in the <a href="/faq/cryptocurrency-wallets/" target="_blank">wallet</a> itself, it's on the blockchain. It only manages your keys.
