This recent material release about blockchain, "Deloitteâ€™s 2020 Global Blockchain Survey From Promise to Reality," indicated that there is a considerable increase of interest in the utilization of blockchain technology among leading companies world-wide, creating a huge demand for professionals in the blockchain space. Another equality important research result by Gartner in 2020, blockchain-enabled applications will deliver $3.1 trillion dollars in value by 2030. As the blockchain ecosystem expands in the next 10 years, as indicated in these new research results, the industry will be needing specialists, developers, and experts, all over the world. 

# Rationale
We believed in Althash Education that as early innovators and adaptors in Blockchain Studies, professionalization and standardization is needed to produce qualified professionals. The Blockchain Education sector should respond by offering courses that will prepare the workforce in the institutional shift from centralized oriented to decentralized oriented framework of doing and thinking. This can be best observed in the way we develop software  to the manner we deliver government services.

This looming demand for capable professionals must be addressed to maintain the United States competitiveness in blockchain innovation globally. One way of doing this is by supporting blockchain educational programs run by non-for-profit institutions.

Blockchain Institute - Chicago will provide live lectures and student support during predetermined lecture periods and office hours.

The US must cope with this global trend to be at par among other nation-states in this new era of Blockchain Economy. Mass adoption must be promoted, continued support among industry leaders, technology entrepreneurs, business innovators and professionals must be enhanced for the United States to be competitive. 

Blockchain technology triggers institutional shift from centralized to decentralized conceptual framework of operation and thinking. This monumental change is so vital that other dominant economies of the world like China, Brazil, Israel and Germany are among the top innovators in space. China for example is continuously advancing in conquering new frontiers in the banking industry, the Digital Yuan, it's newest central bank digital currency.

In the end Htmlcoin believed that blockchain should not be limited to cryptocurrencies as there is much more than can be achieved with the technology. That is why it has invested much of its resources in impacting both technical and leadership competencies on students, some of which have gone ahead to begin their own blockchain projects.
