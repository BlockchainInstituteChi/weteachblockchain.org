name: Corey DiNardo
role: Marketing & Communications
summary: Corey takes care of marketing, social media and also does copywriting for the Institute. If you reach out to us, he is the person that will get back to you so please feel free to say hi. Corey saw the need for more accessible blockchain education after having a friend try to explain bitcoin, blockchain, and ethereum numerous times, unsuccessfully. He learned more about decentralized systems by figuring out how to get his computer GPU mining ethereum. Corey majored in marketing at Ohio University where he graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration. He previously worked in product operations for one of the fastest-growing (and then fastest shrinking) tech start-ups in Chicago. In his spare time, Corey likes to take photos and drown himself in coffee.
