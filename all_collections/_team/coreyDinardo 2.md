summary: Corey takes care of marketing, social media and also does copywriting for the Institute. Corey saw the need for more accessible blockchain education after having a friend try to explain bitcoin, blockchain, and ethereum numerous times, unsuccessfully. As he learned more, he was able to configure his computer to mine Ethereum and became an advocate for decentralization. He previously worked in product operations for a tech start-up in downtown Chicago. In his spare time, Corey enjoys spending time in nature and taking photos.
