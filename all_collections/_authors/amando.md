I am a Ph.D. candidate in Instructional Technology at Northern Illinois University. I have completed the defense of my dissertation and am currently engaged in the revision process. I am scheduled to receive my doctorate degree next year. As a blockchain evangelist, my goal is to deliver, through Althash Blockchain and Htmlcoin, innovative distributed ledger-based products and services.
