Collective imagination is something I see as essential to the human experience. After all, we humans are equally imaginative, creative, and social. We want to explore and discover, but we want to do it together.

I believe our common aspirations, goals, and experiences will guide the movement and advancement of “decentralized technology” in the blockchain environment. As a blockchain evangelist, my goal is to deliver, through Althash Blockchain and Htmlcoin, innovative distributed ledger-based products and services.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Instructional Technology at Northern Illinois University. I have completed the defense of my dissertation and am currently engaged in the revision process. I am scheduled to receive my doctorate degree next year.
