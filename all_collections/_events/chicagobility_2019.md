The Family Matters nonprofit, working in partnership with the City of Chicago and their Chicagobility program arranges a summer program to teach and inspire teens between the ages of 14-16 with educational programming.

This year, during their technology week, Managing Director Hannah Rosenberg stopped by to teach attendees about the basics of blockchain technology. Hannah and Blockchain Institute were happy for the opportunity to provide an introduction to blockchain to such a young audience.

Beyond explaining the technology and its potential impact, Hannah went on to lead a hands-on demonstration where some students conducted a transaction via a blockchain network while others would look up the corresponding transaction receipt via a block explorer.
