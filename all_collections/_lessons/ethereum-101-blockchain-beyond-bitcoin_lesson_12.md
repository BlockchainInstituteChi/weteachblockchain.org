Instead of wasting energy to prove authenticity, a staking model would allow network participants with substantial Ether holdings to stake these coins as collateral. While this proposal is still in the early stages, other cryptocurrency networks such as Tezos have successfully implemented staking as a way to streamline block production. </span>

<span>As the network grows, it is anticipated that a Proof-of-Stake based system would provide a less wasteful solution, while also enabling greater scale of block production. In the meantime, Proof-of=Work has proven to be a suitable solution for most applications.</span>
