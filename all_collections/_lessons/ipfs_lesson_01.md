As with any technology,<a href="https://ipfs.io/"> InterPlanetary File System</a> (IPFS) is a combination of solutions to problems that had existed in the past. Storage technology is at the core of everything we think of as computers.

Player Pianos, dating back to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_piano" rel="noopener">early 18th century</a>, were the first real form of digital storage. The notches on a steel cylinder pulled tensioned lines, effectively playing a song when the springs were pulled by an attendant. Our modern hard drives are not much more complex than this, using electrical charge rather than the mechanical potential of a spring, but otherwise very similar.

In the early days of computing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_storage">storage devices</a> were coupled with processing units in single purpose systems; however, with the introduction of high-speedÂ internet, these two components are now commonly separated by hundreds of miles. As cloud services have grown, the notion of storage has shifted from physical hard drives to a network of high-availability devices for rent.

The goal of IPFS is to provide a common protocol for networks of computers to use to share their storage. This quickly growing community has collaborated to build this open-source project which might truly become an InterPlanetary File System.
