<span class="openingParagraph">To understand the potential of blockchain technology, it’s helpful to understand the context of this wave of innovation by looking at the first blockchain, Bitcoin, and its first use-case, digital money.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The concepts and ideas that would lead to blockchain and cryptocurrency date back to the early 1980s. The following 25 years saw the rise and fall of many digital cash projects and culminated in Satoshi Nakamoto creating Bitcoin, the first blockchain. Nakamoto solved problems faced by previous failed digital cash projects. This included maintaining a reliable peer-to-peer network that can transfer value and preventing against counterfeit. Satoshi Nakamoto’s creation was a transparent, secure ledger that could not be compromised; once any information was added to the chain, it cannot be removed. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The architecture of a blockchain allows users to interact in a system where digitral trust is established by trusting the transparent protocol, as opposed to employing the use of expensive third party faciliatotrs. Blockchains are able to do this by having the network members reach consensus, a computationally-intensive process where users agree on the state of the network while employing secure cryptography. While there are many apparent benefits to blockchains, the technology is still relatively young and is yet to meet the full demand faced by popular networks today. Despite these unknowns, there is still a lot of intrigue over the potential impact of blockchain technologies.</span>
