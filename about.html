            <p>Education is the best tool to light the way forward. We invite you to join us as we show the world why
                blockchain is here to stay.</p>
                <p>Blockchain Institute was founded in June of <a href="/press-releases" target="_blank">2018</a> to promote the adoption,
                    development, and use of blockchain technology by providing free education to the public. Throughout the
                    first few months of our existence, <a href="/events" target="_blank">we taught workshops and attended
                        conferences</a> such as <a href="/events/girlcon_2018" target="_blank">Girlcon</a>, <a
                        href="/events/loyalty_live_2018" target="_blank">Loyalty Live</a>, and <a href="/events/VOB_2018"
                        target="_blank">Voice of Blockchain</a>. Our first online courses were made available in February
                    2019. Later that year on March 25 we were officially granted status as a <span
                        class="no-wrap">501(c)(3)</span> Public Charity.</p>

        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <p>In August 2019, we moved into Hackhaus, a co-working space located in the Uptown neighborhood of
                Chicago. The new location gave us the ability to host in-person courses and meetups. Our first in-person
                class, the Crypto Curious Course, was previewed in November 2019 and premiered on January 25th, 2020. We launched our ambassador program in June of 2020 to offer people around the world the tools to teach this new technology to others.
            </p>
		<p>In 2021 we unveiled our Demystifying DeFi Course to explain the traditional financial services that have come to the decentralized world. We also started regularly teaching our courses to an international audience over webinars.</p>
            <p>We will continue to add to our collection of online and in-person classes and look for new ways to
                provide blockchain education to all.</p>
