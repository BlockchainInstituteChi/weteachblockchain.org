			<h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Blockchain Institute is a 501(c)(3) Public Charity that provides education focused on blockchain, cryptocurrency, and distributed ledger technology.

			<p>We were founded in June of 2018 to promote the adoption, development, and use of blockchain technology by providing free education to the public. Throughout the first few months of our existence, we taught workshops and attended conferences such as <a href="/events/girlcon_2018" target="_blank">Girlcon</a>, <a href="/events/loyalty_live_2018" target="_blank">Loyalty Live</a>, and <a href="/events/VOB_2018" target="_blank">Voice of Blockchain</a>. Our first online courses were made available in February 2019. Later that year on March 25 we were officially granted status as a 501(c)(3) Public Charity.</p>
			<p>During August 2019 we moved into Hackhaus, a co-working space located in the Uptown neighborhood of Chicago. The new location gave us the ability to host in-person courses and meetups. Our first in-person class, the Crypto Curious Course, was previewed in November 2019 and premiered on January 25th, 2020.</p>
			<p>We will continue to add to our collection of online and in-person classes and look for new ways to provide blockchain education to all.</p>
