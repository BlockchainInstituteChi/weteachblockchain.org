            <p>Education is the best tool to light the way forward. We invite you to join us as we show the world why
                blockchain is here to stay.</p>
                <p>We were founded in June of <a href="/press-releases" target="_blank">2018</a> to promote the adoption,
                    development, and use of blockchain technology by providing free education to the public. Throughout the
                    first few months of our existence, <a href="/events" target="_blank">we taught workshops and attended
                        conferences</a> such as <a href="/events/girlcon_2018" target="_blank">Girlcon</a>, <a
                        href="/events/loyalty_live_2018" target="_blank">Loyalty Live</a>, and <a href="/events/VOB_2018"
                        target="_blank">Voice of Blockchain</a>. Our first online courses were made available in February
                    2019. Later that year on March 25 we were officially granted status as a <span
                        class="no-wrap">501(c)(3)</span> Public Charity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-6">
            <p>During August 2019 we moved into Hackhaus, a co-working space located in the Uptown neighborhood of
                Chicago. The new location gave us the ability to host in-person courses and meetups. Our first in-person
                class, the Crypto Curious Course, was previewed in November 2019 and premiered on January 25th, 2020.
            </p>
            <p>We will continue to add to our collection of online and in-person classes and look for new ways to
                provide blockchain education to all.</p>
